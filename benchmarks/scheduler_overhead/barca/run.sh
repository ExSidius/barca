# tests/integration/test_benchmark_examples.sh auto-discovers every
# benchmarks/*/barca/run.sh and asserts it exits 0 (run from a random temp cwd).
# The full three-framework comparison lives in ../bench.sh and takes minutes;
# this smoke instead exploits barca's *sub-minute* cron to prove the scheduler
# actually fires, end to end, in ~10 seconds: it serves a `*/2 * * * * *` job
# and checks the task body ran at least twice.

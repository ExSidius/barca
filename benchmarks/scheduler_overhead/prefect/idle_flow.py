"""Prefect scheduler benchmark — idle-footprint fixture (10 far-future schedules).

Serves ten deployments of a no-op flow, each on a `0 0 1 1 *` (00:00 Jan 1)
cron: registered and polled by the single `.serve()` process but never firing
during the measurement window, isolating idle footprint from execution.
